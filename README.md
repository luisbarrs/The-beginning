# The-beginning

Hello! I'm Luis Enrique Barriga Sairitupa, a student at the National University of San Agustin of Arequipa in the country of Per√∫. I'm interested in STATA and Rstudio programming language, as well as the use of LaTeX for editing research documents.

Regarding the research topics in which I'm interested in Stochastic Frontier Models for effiency analysis in the agricultural, manufacturing and other sectors. In addition, the issue of education and wages, for whose analysis different types of econometric models are used for cross-sectional or panel data.

Soon I will be publishing Do files and Scripts for downloading data obtained from different surveys carried out by INEI in Peru.
